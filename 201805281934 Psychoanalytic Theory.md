Freud divided the psyche into two fundamentally distinct models of activity.
The Primary Process: unconscious. Neuronal energy is freely mobile.
The Secondary Process: Rational Thinking. Neuronal energy is bound.

The secondary process in maintained by an organising neural 'mass' called the ego which exerts control over the primary process.

Pathological characteristics can emerge when Freud's ego restricts either __too much__ or __too little__.

The Primary Process: the exchange of "neuronal energy" is freely mobile and its psychological dynamics are characterised by disorded, vagueness, conceptual paradox, symbolic imagery, intense emotions, and animistic thinking.

The Secondary Process: the exchange of "neuronal energy" is bound. Characterised by order, precision, conceptual consistency, controlled emotions and rational thinking.

Freud hypothesised that the secondary process is maintained by an orgranising neural "mass" called the ego which "contains" and exerts control over the primary process by binding primary process activity into its own pattern of activity.

When Freud's ego is suppressed, such as during dream sleep, wider worlds of experience can emerge. 

Disturbances in perception caused by LSD make it impossible for the ego to integrate the evidence of the sense and to coordinate its activities.

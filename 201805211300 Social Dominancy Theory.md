Humans are predisposed to group-based social hierarchies by nature.

All familiar forms of group-based oppression. e.g racism, ethnocentrism, classism, sexism etc are special cases of a more general tendency for humans to form and maintain group-based hierarchy.

Strategic oppression is deemed an immutable consequence of human nature.

Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) is the human predisposition that drives this group-based hierarchy. Implied as an evolutionary trait in human psychology generating a tendency toward favoring demonitation of others and other nonegalitarian inters.

All known surplus-producing social systems are, in fact, organized as group-based social hierarchies.

But evidence from hunter-gatherer groups disputes SDT claims.

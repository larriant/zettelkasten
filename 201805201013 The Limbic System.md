Limbic function is now recognized as central to the emotions that fuel our best and worst behavior.

The hypothalamus, a limbic structure, is the interface between layers 1 and 2, between core regulator and emotional parts of the brain.

The hypothalamus gets massive inputs from limbic layer 2 structures but disproportionately sends projects to layer 1 regions.

The autonomic nervous system has two parts.

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

SNS mediates the body's response to arousing circumstances.
Producing the famed 'fight or flight' stress response.

SNS meiates the "four Fs - fear, fight, flight and sex"

SNS neurotransmitter: *norepinephrine* and *epinephrine* (aka noradrenaline and adrenaline)

PNS is about calm, vegetative states.

The SNS speeds up the heart, the PNS slows it down.

The PNS promotes digestion, the SNS inhibits it.

PNS neurotransmitter: *acetylcholine*.

It is the incredibly interesting frontal cortex that is the interface between layers 2 and 3.

In different circumstances the frontal cortex and limbic system stimulate or inhibit each other.

The Default Mode Network is engaged during higher level meta-cognition activities such as:
+ Self-reflection
+ Theory of Mind
+ Mental Time Travel

Metacognition is the ability to reflect on one's own thoughts and behaviors. These functions may be exclusive to humans.

The DMN serves as a central orchestrator or conductor of global brain function. i.e. it's the seat of the ego.

DMN activity is reduced during:
+ psychadelics
+ meditation
+ REM sleep

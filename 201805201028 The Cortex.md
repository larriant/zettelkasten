The cortex is the gleaming, logical, analytical crown of layer 3.

Most sensory information flows there to be decoded.

It is the incredibly interesting frontal cortex that is the interface between layers 2 and 3.


The cortex is not a smooth surface but instead is folded into convolutions.

The convolutions form a superstructure of four separate lobes.

1. The temporal
2. The parietal
3. The occipital
4. The frontal

Each has different functions.

Brains have left and right sides, or "hemispheres", that roughly mirror each other.

Brain regions come in pairs. i.e. a left and right amygdala.

Functions are often lateralized, such that the left and right hippocampi have different but related functions.

The greatest lateralization occurs in the cortex. The left hemisphere is analytical, the right more involved in intuition and creativity.

But functional differences between the hemispheres are generally subtle.

The "Entropy" of a brain is a measure of its level of disorder or randomness.

Low Entropy - Very fixed thought patterns
* Common in Depressed and Anxious patients.

High Entropy - Loose, disorderded thought patterns.
* In children.
* In Schitzophrenic or manic depressive patients.
* After taking a psychadelic.

“Thus, according to the entropic brain hypothesis, just as normally robust principles about the brain lose definition in primary states, so confidence is lost in ‘how the world is’ and ‘who one is’ as a personality”[@10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020]

This entropy-suppressing function of the human brain serves to promote realism, foresight, careful reflection and an ability to recognize and overcome wishful and paranoid fantasies.

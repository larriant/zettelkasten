IIT demonstates how [[201805161546 The Entropic Brain]] can be operationalized.

IIT describes the brainâ€™s continual challenge of minimizing entropy while retaining flexibility.

Brains attempt to optimize the give-and-take dynamic between cause-effect information and cognitive flexibility.

In IIT, a (neural) system generates cause-effect information when the mechanisms which make up its current state constrain the set of states which could casually precede or follow the current state.

In other words, each mechanistic state of the brain: (1) limits the set of past states which could have causally given rise to it, and (2) limits the set of future states which can causally follow from it. 

Using this IIT-based framework, psychedelic brain states exhibit higher entropy, higher cognitive flexibility, but lower cause-effect information.

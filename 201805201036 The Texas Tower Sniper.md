Whitman was literally an Eagle Scout with an IQ in the 99th percentile.

In prior years he had seen doctors complaining of severe headaches and violent impulses.

His suicide note requested an autopsy of his brain.

The autopsy proved his intuition correct.

He had a glioblastoma tumor pressing on his amygdala.

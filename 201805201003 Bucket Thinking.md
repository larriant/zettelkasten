We often break down human behaviour into explanatory buckets. Each specialist has their own explanation for behaviour form the evolutionary biologists to the neuroscientists. But in fact all of them are true.

Behaviour: Why did the chicken cross the road?

If you're an evolutionary biologist you say:
"Because over thousands of years of evolution chickens that responded to mates nearby were more likely to survive and thus passed on more genes"

That is their "bucket" and every other field has their own bucket answer.

*But*
1. The boundaries between buckets are often arbitrary.

2. If you pay lots of attention to where boundaries are, it's harder to see the bigger picture.

*Instead*
Buckets instead should be seen as the end product of all the biological influences that came before it.

So a "neurobiological", "developmental" or "genetic" explanation is just shorthand (a convenenience) for approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective.

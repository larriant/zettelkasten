We're always either in focused or diffuse modes of thinking.

Focused:
+ When you're concentrating super hard.
+ A direct approach to solving familar problems.

Diffuse:
+ More of a search neural pattern.
+ Thoughts move widely.
+ More broad/big-picture.

How to access diffuse mode deliberately:
Dali: relax in his chair with a key in his hand and be woked up by the clatter. Wake up and take new insights into focused mode.

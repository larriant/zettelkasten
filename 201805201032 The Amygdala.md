The amygdala is the archetypal limbic structure.

Is it central to mediating agression.

## Evidence
1. When animals are being aggressive. Amygdala neurons have action potentials.

2. Lesion amygdala in an animal -> rates of aggression decline.

3. Show human subjects pictures that provoke anger -> the amygdala activates

## Amygdala and Fear
Amygdala is also linked with feeling afraid and anxious.

Crucially, the brain region most involved in feeling afraid and anxious is most involved in generating aggression.

The amygdala helps mediate both innate and learned fear.

Innate fear (aka a phobia): you don't have to learn by trial and error that something is aversive.

"Prepared learning": instead of inevitable fear, we will more easily learn to be afraid of snakes and spiders than pandas or beagles.

Central amygdala has key role in innate fears.

Surrounding it the basolateral amygdala (BLA) which learns fear and then sends the news to the central amygdala.

In the[[201805201045 The Ultimatum Game]] research shows that rejecting an offer is an emotional decision, triggered by anger at a lousy offer and the desire to punish.

# Inputs to the amygdala
1. The BLA gets projections from all the sensory systems.
2. Usually this is via the cortex but there is also a shortcut. So the amygdala can scream "it's a gun" super quickly.
3. Information about pain. This is mediated by the "periaqueductal gray" (PAG).
4. Disgust of all stripes. "Insular cortex" projects this.

# Outputs from the amygdala
1. Bidirectional connections.
2. The hippocampus. 
3. Motor outputs. Also shortcut to allow amygala to talk directly.
4. Arousal. Layer 2 limbic amygdala signals layer 1 regions, and heart rate and blood pressure soar.


Amygdalaâ€™s dual role in both aggression and facets of fear and anxiety.

A simple model of the human brain that divides it into 3 sections:

1. Layer 1: The Reptilian Brain
    + Mediates automatic, regulatory functions.
    + If body temperature drops. This brain region senses it and sends commands to shiver.

2. Layer 2: The Limbic System
    + Somewhat of a mammalian invention.
    + To do with emotions.
    + If you see something gruesome and terrifying, this layer sends commands down to anciet layer 1, making you shiver with emotion.

3. The Cortex
    + Hugely expanded area in primates.
    + Cognition, memory storage, sensory processing, abstractions, philosophy.
    + Read a scary passage of a book, and layer 3 siganls layer 2 to make you feel frightened, proptimng later 1 to initiate shivers.

## Disadvantages
1. Anatomically there is considerable overlap among the three layers.
2. The flow of information and commands is not just top down. (if someone is holding a cold they're more likely to judge someone they meet as having a cold personality.)
3. Automatic aspects of behaviour are not seperable.
4. Leads one to erroneously think that evolution slapped on each new layer without any changes occurring in what was already there.

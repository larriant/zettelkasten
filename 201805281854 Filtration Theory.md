Filtration Theory states that the brain acts as a filter that limits information that reaches consciousness to what is biologically useful.

Theory that changed the name to _psychadelic_ which means "mind-manifesting".

Huxley saw the biological function of the brain as a “device” engaged in a continuous process of elimination and inhibition to sustain the “normal self” of everyday waking experience to maximize adaptive fit.

On the ‘inlet’ (right) side of the cerebral reducing valve is a vast ocean of all possible perceptual, emotional, and cognitive experiences.

On the ‘outlet’ (left) side is our moment-to-moment stream of experience in normal waking life. 

The cerebral reducing valve is a normal brain function that limits our mental processes to an awareness, most of the time, of what is biologically useful.

According to filtration theorists, consciousness is ordinarily kept narrow by biological and psychological selection processes that exclude a great deal of subconscious material.

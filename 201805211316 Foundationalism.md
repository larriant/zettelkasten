Foundationalism is the view that all knowledge ultimately rests on a foundation of non-inferential understandings or pre-justified belief.

It is a response to the infinite regress problem.

Every statement requires a justification. Thus any proposition or statement of fact can be endlessly questioned to infinity.

"God created the universe" -> "Who created God?"
